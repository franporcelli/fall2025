    "# Web scraping Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "This lecture is about on how to get \"cheap\" data, off the web and onto our computer. This is a very useful skill to have, as it allows us to collect data that is not available in a downloadable format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web scraping is the process of extracting information from websites. It simulates the human browsing behavior to extract information from websites. The information is then converted into a structured format that can be further analyzed and stored in a database. There are two ways that web content gets rendered in a browser:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Server-side rendering: The server sends the HTML content to the browser, which then renders the content.\n",
    "2. Client-side rendering: The server sends a minimal HTML content to the browser, which then executes JavaScript code to render the content.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read [here](https://www.codeconquest.com/website/client-side-vs-server-side/) for more details (incluiding example scripts), but for the purposed of this lecture, we will focus on the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Server-side rendering\n",
    "\n",
    "* The scripts that “build” the website are not run on our computer, but rather on a host server that sends down all of the HTML code.\n",
    "E.g. Wikipedia tables are already populated with all of the information — numbers, dates, etc. — that we see in our browser.\n",
    "* In other words, the information that we see in our browser has already been processed by the host server.\n",
    "* You can think of this information being embeded directly in the webpage’s HTML.\n",
    "* **Webscraping challenges**: Finding the correct CSS (or Xpath) “selectors”. Iterating through dynamic webpages (e.g. “Next page” and “Show More” tabs).\n",
    "* Key concepts: CSS, Xpath, HTML\n",
    "\n",
    "### Client-side rendering\n",
    "* The website contains an empty template of HTML and CSS.\n",
    "E.g. It might contain a “skeleton” table without any values.\n",
    "* However, when we actually visit the page URL, our browser sends a request to the host server.\n",
    "* If everything is okay (e.g. our request is valid), then the server sends a response script, which our browser executes and uses to populate the HTML template with the specific information that we want.\n",
    "* **Webscraping challenges**: Finding the “API endpoints” can be tricky, since these are sometimes hidden from view.\n",
    "* Key concepts: APIs, API endpoints\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Over this lecture, we'll go over the server-side rendering, which is the most common type of rendering. However, I want to forewarn you that webscraping typically involves a fair bit of detective work. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will often have to adjust your steps according to the type of data you want, and the steps that worked on one website may not work on another. (Or even work on the same website a few months later). \n",
    "\n",
    "**All this is to say that webscraping involves as much art as it does science.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The good news is that both server-side and client-side websites allow for webscraping.1 If you can see it in your browser, you can scrape it!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Caveat: Ethical and legal considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "TLDR; Just because you can scrape it, doesn’t mean you should.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is currently legal (read more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HiQ_Labs_v._LinkedIn)) to scrape public websites, but there are some important caveats to keep in mind: it’s still important to realise that the tools we’ll be using over these next two lectures are very powerful. A computer can process commands much, much faster than we can ever type them up manually. It’s pretty easy to write up a function or program that can overwhelm a host server or application through the sheer weight of requests. Or, just as likely, the host server has built-in safeguards that will block you in case of a suspected malicious attack. So, be careful and nice when scraping websites 🙂.\n",

    "\n",
    "### What is MechanicalSoup?\n",
    "\n",
    "[MechanicalSoup](https://mechanicalsoup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is a Python browser automation library built on top of `Requests` (for making HTTP requests) and `BeautifulSoup` (for parsing HTML). It acts as a headless browser, mimicking a browser's behavior without the need for a graphical user interface. This makes it lightweight and efficient compared to full-fledged browser automation tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here a simple example of using `MechanicalSoup` to open a webpage, print its title, and close the browser session:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import mechanicalsoup\n",
    "\n",
    "browser = mechanicalsoup.StatefulBrowser()\n",
    "browser.open(\"https://example.com\")\n",
    "page = browser.get_current_page()\n",
    "print(page.title.text)\n",
    "browser.close()\n",
    "```"

    "### Why use MechanicalSoup for web scraping?\n",
    "\n",
    "`MechanicalSoup` provides some features that make it a valuable tool for web scraping:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Navigation\n",
    "- Form handling\n",
    "- Session management\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Navigation\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Follow a link by its text\n",
    "browser.follow_link(\"Login\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Follow a link by its URL\n",
    "browser.visit(\"https://example.com/next_page\")\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Form handling\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from mechanicalsoup import Browser\n",
    "\n",
    "# Replace with the login URL you want\n",
    "browser = Browser()\n",
    "browser.open(\"https://old.reddit.com\")  # Example login form\n",
    "\n",
    "# Find the login form\n",

    "\n",
    "# Fill the form fields\n",
    "login_form[\"username\"] = \"your_username\"\n",
    "login_form[\"password\"] = \"your_password\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Submit the form\n",
    "browser.submit_selected()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Access the response data (assuming successful login)\n",
    "response = browser.soup\n",
    "content = response.find(\"pre\").text\n",
    "print(content)  # This should print the form data submitted\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Session management\n",
    "\n",
    "`MechanicalSoup` automatically manages cookies and other session information:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Access data from a protected page after login (session is maintained)\n",
    "content = browser.soup.find(\"div\", class_=\"protected_content\").text\n",

    "`MechanicalSoup` is a powerful tool for web scraping, but it is not the only one. Other popular libraries include `Scrapy`, `Selenium`, and `BeautifulSoup`. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses, so it's important to choose the right tool for the job.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### MechanicalSoup vs. BeautifulSoup\n",
    "While both libraries are used for web scraping, `MechanicalSoup` and `BeautifulSoup` have distinct functionalities:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `BeautifulSoup`: This library specializes in parsing HTML content. It excels at identifying and extracting data from downloaded HTML code. However, it doesn't handle tasks like form submission, navigation, or session management.\n",
    "- `MechanicalSoup`: Built on top of `BeautifulSoup`, `MechanicalSoup` adds form handling, navigation, and session management functionalities. It allows you to interact with websites more dynamically by mimicking user behavior.\n",
    "If you simply need to extract data from downloaded HTML content, `BeautifulSoup` is sufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your scraping task involves interacting with forms, navigating through pages, or maintaining sessions, `MechanicalSoup` is the better choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### MechanicalSoup vs. Selenium\n",
    "\n",
    "Another popular library for web scraping is `Selenium`, as it provides full-fledged browser automation. Here's a breakdown of the key differences between `Selenium` and `MechanicalSoup`:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `Selenium` can handle complex JavaScript, render pages with dynamic content, and automate browser interactions beyond scraping.\n",
    "    - `MechanicalSoup` focuses on scraping tasks and doesn't mimic advanced browser behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Complexity\n",
    "    - `Selenium` has a steeper learning curve due to its comprehensive functionality.\n",
    "    - `MechanicalSoup` offers a simpler API, which makes it easier to learn and use for basic scraping tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Performance\n",
    "    - `Selenium` is slower, and so may require more processing power due to its browser emulation capabilities.\n",
    "    - `MechanicalSoup` is generally faster for simpler tasks as it doesn't involve full browser rendering.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to handle advanced JavaScript or mimic complex browser interactions, `Selenium` is the way to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "For most basic scraping tasks, especially for static websites and those with straightforward forms and navigation, `MechanicalSoup` is a more efficient and lightweight option.\n",
